# CFileManager ü¶é
CFileManager is a lightweight C library for managing file systems and file metadata. It provides a consistent API for:
- Creating, verifying, and deleting directories
- Validating file existence and structure
- Generating unique file paths for safe storage
- Copying and deleting files, and retrieving file attributes (e.g., size, extension)
- Reading, writing, and updating file metadata (UUID, name, size, timestamps)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This project includes functional tests for validating the library's behavior. Integration and usage in production systems are left to the implementer.

## Features
- **File & Directory Operations:**  
  Create and delete directories, check file existence, retrieve file size, and copy files.
- **Metadata Handling:**  
  Store, retrieve, and update file metadata, including:
    - `uuid` ‚Äì unique file identifier
    - `filename` ‚Äì file name
    - `size` ‚Äì file size
    - `created_at` ‚Äì timestamp of creation
    - `modified_at` ‚Äì timestamp of last modification
- **Utility Functions:**  
  Extra functions to check if a path is a directory, get a file extension, and more.

## Test Structure
The project includes comprehensive functional and integration tests that cover all features:
1. **File Storage Tests:**
    - Create and validate test directories and files
    - Generate unique paths and save files
    - Clean up test artifacts
2. **Metadata Tests:**
    - Validate saving (`save_metadata`), loading (`load_metadata`), and updating (`update_metadata`) metadata
3. **Utility Tests:**
    - Check if path is a directory (`is_directory`)
    - Verify file existence (`file_exists`)
    - Get file size (`get_file_size`)
    - Delete and copy files (`remove_file`, `copy_file`)
    - Get file extension (`get_file_extension`)

## Build & Run Tests
### Building
This project uses CMake for build configuration. To compile the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

All tests passed!
```

## Requirements
- C Compiler (e.g., gcc or clang)
- CMake
- POSIX Environment (for file system operations)

## Usage & Conclusion
This library offers functions for managing files, directories, and metadata. The included tests verify the correctness and stability of all components. Integration is flexible ‚Äî you can use the entire library or select only the modules you need, depending on your application requirements.
